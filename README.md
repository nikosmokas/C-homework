# C-homework


The course exposes 1st year students to the main concepts of programming and problem solving with computers. We introduce C, a classic, powerful procedural programming language. The course includes a mandatory lab in which participants apply in practice – in a series of exercises – the material taught in class in order to familiarize themselves with the concepts and techniques.
After successfully fulfilling the requirements of the course, the student is capable of:

->  Analyzing the requirements of problems which are to be solved with a computer and synthesizing a solution. <br>
->  Producing solutions which strictly comply with given specifications.
->  Knowing the main characteristics and structures of the C programming language and applying the most appropriate on a case-by-case basis to implement his/her algorithmic solutions.
->  Applying the basic principles of software engineering in order to organize his/her code efficiently (structure, readability, design).
->  Verifying the correctness of programs and identifying errors.
->  Using program development and debugging tools.
->  Working both individually and synergistically in small groups, with specific time limitations.

Also: 


->  Understanding of the role of the operating system.
->  Understanding of how software is layered in a computer.
->  Understanding of how programs are executed concurrently on a computer.
->  Knowledge of the process creation/control functions, the file system functions, and the interprocess communication mechanisms, and elementary understanding of how this functionality is implemented by the operating system.
->  Application/usage of the above functions at a practical level.
